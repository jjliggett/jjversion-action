# jjversion-action

jjversion-action is a composite GitHub action that uses the Go package [jjliggett/jjversion](https://github.com/jjliggett/jjversion) to calculate a version for a git repository and parse version attributes as GitHub Action outputs.

## Usage

For this action to work properly, you must create a versioning.yaml file in your repository and checkout your repository in your workflow with ```fetch-depth: 0``` to fetch all history for all tags and branches. Configuration information for the versioning.yaml file can be found in the <https://github.com/jjliggett/jjversion> repository.

### Inputs

The action accepts the following input:

```yaml
  skip-go-installation:
    description: "If set to true, then the action uses pre-installed Go"
    default: "false"
    required: false
```

### Outputs

The action creates the following outputs:

- major
- minor
- patch
- majorMinorPatch
- sha
- shortSha

### Example Usage
